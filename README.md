Fuzz Faster u Fool

ffuf stands for Fuzz Faster U Fool. It's a tool used for web enumeration, fuzzing, and directory brute forcing.


FFuF is designed to be fast and flexible, allowing users to customize and fine-tune the fuzzing process to suit their specific needs. It supports a wide range of input sources, including wordlists, JSON files, and even custom input generators. Users can also specify various options and parameters, such as the HTTP method, headers, cookies, and authentication tokens.<br>

FFuF uses multiple threads to send requests and can perform several types of fuzzing, including directory discovery, parameter discovery, and input validation. It can also detect common web application vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Remote Code Execution (RCE).<br>

One of the key features of FFuF is its ability to integrate with other tools, such as Burp Suite and ZAP, allowing users to incorporate fuzzing into their existing security testing workflows. <br>
